= RFC Format Tools Plan =  == Components ==  === !ElfTools === * !PublicationFormatter * Text Submission * idnits  ==== Strategy ==== Build the initial text converter, then go on with the 2to3 converter, preptool, and plaintext xml2rfc.  At that point, interleave the idnits rewrite, and a second round of the plaintext converter (the first round would emit xml useful with the current xml2rfc, while the second round would emit v3 xml2rfc) and then finish with the html xml2rfc and pdf xml2rfc.  === Soaring Hawk === * svgcheck * RFClint * XML Diff  ==== Strategy ====  Phase 1: Most RFClint functionality, svgchecker, xmldiff (outputting a basic html file)  Phase 2: add interactive aspell to rfclint, xmldiff (advanced html file output), issue fixes  Phase 3: issue fixes   == Released == || 2017 || text converter to v2 ||  || v2 to v3 converter ||  || text converter to v3 || 2018 || preptool (though improvements are anticipated as the other tools advance) || || svgcheck || || xml diff phase 1 || || rfclint phase 1 || || xmldiff phase 2 || || v3 to text (xml2rfc) || || rfclint phase 2 || || final delivery rfclint, xmldiff, svgcheck || || v3 to html (xml2rfc) || || v3 to pdf (xml2rfc) || || idnits
